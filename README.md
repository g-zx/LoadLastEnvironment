# LoadLastEnvironment
Bigscreen mod that restores the last used environment in your room.

## Version history
- 0.1 - First release
- 0.2 - Bugfix

## Installation
1. Download the latest version of LoadLastEnvironment.dll from the [Releases](https://github.com/g-zx/LoadLastEnvironment/releases) page.
2. Copy the file into your Bigscreen\Mods\ folder.

Requires the Bigscreen mod loader to run. Follow the instructions in the [Bigscreen Modding Guide](https://cal117.gitbook.io/bsmg) to install the mod loader.

The default location of your Bigscreen Mods folder can be found at the following location for each platform respectively:

| Platform     | Location                                                           |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Steam        | C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Bigscreen\Mods       |
| Oculus Store | C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\bigscreen-bigscreen\Mods |

## Usage
The environment you select in your own room will be automatically remembered, so that the next time you create a room the last environment used will be set by default.

## Known issues
- On startup, Bigscreen will briefly load the default environment (living room) before switching to the saved one.
  Subsequent exits to your room will work as intended. Haven't found a workaround for this yet.

## Building from source
It's highly recommended that you download the latest [release version](https://github.com/g-zx/LoadLastEnvironment/releases/latest) in .dll form, but if you really want to build from source you can follow the [Modding tutorial](https://cal117.gitbook.io/bsmg/modding-tutorial/quick-start) in the Bigscreen Modding Guide for a guide on how to build from source.
